## üìã Prerequisites

### 1. AWS Account Setup
- AWS account registered to UK organization
- Billing address in the UK
- AWS CLI installed and configured

export ORGANIZATION_NAME="Your-Council-Name"
export DOMAIN_NAME="auditsuite.uk"  # Domain is pre-configured
```

## üöÄ Quick Deployment

### Step 1: Validate Prerequisites
```bash
# Check AWS CLI is installed
aws --version

# Verify AWS configuration (should show your account)
aws sts get-caller-identity

# Ensure you're in UK region
aws configure set region eu-west-2
```

### Step 2: Deploy Infrastructure
```bash
# Navigate to AWS directory
cd aws

# Run the deployment script (configured for auditsuite.uk)
./gdpr-compliance.sh
```

The script will:
- ‚úÖ Validate prerequisites
- ‚úÖ Create VPC with private subnets in eu-west-2 (London)
- ‚úÖ Deploy PostgreSQL RDS with KMS encryption
- ‚úÖ Set up S3 buckets with lifecycle policies
- ‚úÖ Configure CloudTrail for complete audit logging
- ‚úÖ Create security groups with least privilege access
- ‚úÖ Generate production environment configuration for auditsuite.uk

### Step 3: SSL Certificate Setup (AWS Console)
1. **Go to AWS Certificate Manager** (in eu-west-2 region)
2. **Request public certificate** for `auditsuite.uk`
3. **Choose DNS validation** method
4. **Add CNAME records** to your DNS provider (provided by AWS)
5. **Wait for validation** (usually 5-30 minutes)

### Step 4: DNS Configuration
Update your DNS records with your domain registrar:

```dns
# Required DNS Records
CNAME: auditsuite.uk ‚Üí [Load Balancer DNS from deployment output]

# Optional but recommended
CNAME: www.auditsuite.uk ‚Üí auditsuite.uk
```

### Step 5: Application Deployment
```bash
# Copy production environment (pre-configured for auditsuite.uk)
cp backend/.env.production backend/.env

# Install AWS dependencies
cd backend
npm install aws-sdk @aws-sdk/client-s3 @aws-sdk/s3-request-presigner

# Run database migrations (includes GDPR compliance tables)
npm run db:migrate

# Start the application
npm run start
```
